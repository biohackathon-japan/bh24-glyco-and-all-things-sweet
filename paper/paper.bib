            Glycans serve important roles in signaling events and cell-cell communication, and they are recognized by lectins, viruses and bacteria, playing a variety of roles in many biological processes. However, there was no system to organize the plethora of glycan-related data in the literature. Thus GlyTouCan (https://glytoucan.org) was developed as the international glycan repository, allowing researchers to assign accession numbers to glycans. This also aided in the integration of glycan data across various databases. GlyTouCan assigns accession numbers to glycans which are defined as sets of monosaccharides, which may or may not be characterized with linkage information. GlyTouCan was developed to be able to recognize any level of ambiguity in glycans and uniquely assign accession numbers to each of them, regardless of the input text format. In this manuscript, we describe the latest update to GlyTouCan in version 3.0, its usage, and plans for future development.},

            PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a popular chemical information resource that serves a wide range of use cases. In the past two years, a number of changes were made to PubChem. Data from more than 120 data sources was added to PubChem. Some major highlights include: the integration of Google Patents data into PubChem, which greatly expanded the coverage of the PubChem Patent data collection; the creation of the Cell Line and Taxonomy data collections, which provide quick and easy access to chemical information for a given cell line and taxon, respectively; and the update of the bioassay data model. In addition, new functionalities were added to the PubChem programmatic access protocols, PUG-REST and PUG-View, including support for target-centric data download for a given protein, gene, pathway, cell line, and taxon and the addition of the ‘standardize’ option to PUG-REST, which returns the standardized form of an input chemical structure. A significant update was also made to PubChemRDF. The present paper provides an overview of these changes.},

              Integration of glycan-related databases between different research fields is essential in glycoscience. It requires knowledge across the breadth of science because most glycans exist as glycoconjugates. On the other hand, especially between chemistry and biology, glycan data has not been easy to integrate due to the huge variety of glycan structure representations. We have developed WURCS (Web 3.0 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures) as a notation for representing all glycan structures uniquely for the purpose of integrating data across scientific data resources. While the integration of glycan data in the field of biology has been greatly advanced, in the field of chemistry, progress has been hampered due to the lack of appropriate rules to extract sugars from chemical structures. Thus, we developed a unique algorithm to determine the range of structures allowed to be considered as sugars from the structural formulae of compounds, and we developed software to extract sugars in WURCS format according to this algorithm. In this manuscript, we show that our algorithm can extract sugars from glycoconjugate molecules represented at the molecular level and can distinguish them from other biomolecules, such as amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids. Available as software, MolWURCS is freely available and downloadable (
