The Editor allows building of oligo- and polymeric glycan structures and supports most features of natural glycans, such as underdetermined structures, alternative branches, repeating subunits, SMILES specification of atypical monomers, and others. The vocabulary of building blocks contains 600+ monomeric residues, including 327 monosaccharides. Support for SMILES allows input and visualization of chemical structures of virtually unlimited complexity. On the other hand, the interface follows the recognized GlycanBuilder style easy to novice users. The export feature includes support for CSDB Linear, GlycoCT, WURCS, SweetDB, and Glycam notations, SMILES codes, MOL/PDB atomic coordinate formats, raster and vector SNFG images, and on-the-fly visualization as 2D structural formulas and 3D molecular models.

	abstract = {GlyTouCan version 1.0 was released in 2015 as the international glycan structure repository, and a new sequence format called WURCS (Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures) was proposed during the early stages of the GlyTouCan project. GlyTouCan uses WURCS as its base representation for glycans because existing formats were insufficient in their flexibility to represent any and all glycans universally. Therefore, in order to obtain WURCS strings for existing or new glycan structures, conversion tools or glycan structure editors that can export WURCS became necessary. GlycanBuilder was an obvious choice to extend due to its wide usage by the community. However, GlycanBuilder was limited because it was originally developed to support mammalian glycans. It also did not support the newly proposed monosaccharide symbol standard called Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG). Therefore in this work, we implemented a new version of GlycanBuilder to greatly increase its usability. The glycan rendering system was refactored so that cyclic glycans, nested repeating units, monosaccharide compositions and cross-linked glycan structures can be represented. Both import and export utilities for WURCS were also implemented and SNFG symbols were incorporated to allow glycans to be exported as graphics using the latest glycan symbol nomenclature. This new version of GlycanBuilder called "GlycanBuilder2", is able to support a wide variety of ambiguous glycans, including structures containing monosaccharides from bacteria and plants. These glycans can also be displayed using the new SNFG symbols. This tool can aid researchers in communicating about the complex, diverse, and ambiguous structures of glycans more rapidly. Moreover, the new GlycanBuilder can now easily output WURCS sequences from glycans drawn on the canvas. Most importantly, because GlyTouCan employs WURCS as the basic format for registration and searching of glycan information, a wider variety of glycans can now be readily registered and queried in GlyTouCan.},

They form diverse, complicated structures such as branched and cyclic forms. Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures (WURCS) was proposed as a new linear notation for uniquely representing glycans during the GlyTouCan project. WURCS defines rules for complex glycan structures that other text formats did not support, and so it is possible to represent a wide variety glycans. However, WURCS uses a complicated nomenclature, so it is not human-readable. Therefore, we aimed to support the interpretation of WURCS by converting WURCS to the most basic and widely used format IUPAC.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed GlycanFormatConverter and succeeded in converting WURCS to the three kinds of IUPAC formats (IUPAC-Extended, IUPAC-Condensed and IUPAC-Short). Furthermore, we have implemented functionality to import IUPAC-Extended, KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) and LinearCode formats and to export WURCS. We have thoroughly tested our GlycanFormatConverter and were able to show that it was possible to convert all the glycans registered in the GlyTouCan repository, with exceptions owing only to the limitations of the original format. The source code for this conversion tool has been released as an open source tool.

	abstract = {Glycans are important polysaccharides on cellular surfaces that are bound to glycoproteins and glycolipids. These are one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins in eukaryotic cells. They play important roles in protein folding, cell-cell interactions, and other extracellular processes. Changes in glycan structures may influence the course of different diseases, such as infections or cancer. Glycans are commonly represented using the IUPAC-condensed notation. IUPAC-condensed is a textual representation of glycans operating on the same topological level as the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) that assigns colored, geometrical shapes to the main monomers. These symbols are then connected in tree-like structures, visualizing the glycan structure on a topological level. Yet for a representation on the atomic level, notations such as SMILES should be used. To our knowledge, there is no easy-to-use, general, open-source, and offline tool to convert the IUPAC-condensed notation to SMILES. Here, we present the open-access Python package GlyLES for the generalizable generation of SMILES representations out of IUPAC-condensed representations. GlyLES uses a grammar to read in the monomer tree from the IUPAC-condensed notation. From this tree, the tool can compute the atomic structures of each monomer based on their IUPAC-condensed descriptions. In the last step, it merges all monomers into the atomic structure of a glycan in the SMILES notation. GlyLES is the first package that allows conversion from the IUPAC-condensed notation of glycans to SMILES strings. This may have multiple applications, including straightforward visualization, substructure search, molecular modeling and docking, and a new featurization strategy for machine-learning algorithms. GlyLES is available at https://github.com/kalininalab/GlyLES.},

Among various PTMs, glycosylation is one of the most diverse ones. Though many search engines have been developed to decipher proteomic data, some of them are difficult to operate and have poor performance on glycoproteomic datasets compared to advanced glycoproteomic software.To simplify the analysis of proteomic datasets, especially O-glycoproteomic datasets, here, we present a user-friendly proteomic database search platform, MS-Decipher, for the identification of peptides from MS data. Two scoring schemes can be chosen for peptide-spectra matching. It was found that MS-Decipher had the same sensitivity and confidence in peptide identification compared to traditional database searching software. In addition, a special search mode, O-Search, is integrated into MS-Decipher to identify O-glycopeptides for O-glycoproteomic analysis. Compared with Mascot, MetaMorpheus and MSFragger, MS-Decipher can obtain about 139.9\%, 48.8\% and 6.9\% more O-glycopeptide-spectrum matches. A useful tool is provided in MS-Decipher for the visualization of O-glycopeptide-spectra matches. MS-Decipher has a user-friendly graphical user interface, making it easier to operate. Several file formats are available in the searching and validation steps. MS-Decipher is implemented with Java, and can be used cross-platform.MS-Decipher is freely available at https://github.com/DICP-1809/MS-Decipher for academic use.

However, it is difficult to interpret microarray data and identify structural determinants promoting glycan binding to glycan-binding proteins due to the ambiguity in microarray fluorescence intensity and complexity in branched glycan structures. To facilitate analysis of glycan microarray data alongside protein structure, we have built the Glycan Microarray Database (GlyMDB), a web-based resource including a searchable database of glycan microarray samples and a toolset for data/structure analysis.The current GlyMDB provides data visualization and glycan-binding motif discovery for 5203 glycan microarray samples collected from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. The unique feature of GlyMDB is to link microarray data to PDB structures. The GlyMDB provides different options for database query, and allows users to upload their microarray data for analysis. After search or upload is complete, users can choose the criterion for binder versus non-binder classification. They can view the signal intensity graph including the binder/non-binder threshold followed by a list of glycan-binding motifs. One can also compare the fluorescence intensity data from two different microarray samples. A protein sequence-based search is performed using BLAST to match microarray data with all available PDB structures containing glycans. The glycan ligand information is displayed, and links are provided for structural visualization and redirection to other modules in GlycanStructure.ORG for further investigation of glycan-binding sites and glycan structures.http://www.glycanstructure.org/glymdb.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Carbohydrates can have various chemical modifications at different positions, making their chemical space much diverse. Unfortunately, current PDB files do not provide exact annotations for most carbohydrate derivatives and more than 50\% of PDB glycan chains have at least one carbohydrate derivative that could not be correctly recognized by the original Glycan Reader.Glycan Reader has been improved and now identifies most sugar types and chemical modifications (including various glycolipids) in the PDB, and both PDB and PDBx/mmCIF formats are supported.

	abstract = {Motivation: Glycans play critical roles in many biological processes, and their structural diversity is key for specific protein-glycan recognition. Comparative structural studies of biological molecules provide useful insight into their biological relationships. However, most computational tools are designed for protein structure, and despite their importance, there is no currently available tool for comparing glycan structures in a sequence order- and size-independent manner.Results: A novel method, GS-align, is developed for glycan structure alignment and similarity measurement. GS-align generates possible alignments between two glycan structures through iterative maximum clique search and fragment superposition. The optimal alignment is then determined by the maximum structural similarity score, GS-score, which is size-independent. Benchmark tests against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) N-linked glycan library and PDB homologous/non-homologous N-glycoprotein sets indicate that GS-align is a robust computational tool to align glycan structures and quantify their structural similarity. GS-align is also applied to template-based glycan structure prediction and monosaccharide substitution matrix generation to illustrate its utility.Availability and implementation:  http://www.glycanstructure.org/gsalign.Contact:  wonpil@ku.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Glycans are covalent assemblies of sugar that play crucial roles in many cellular processes. Recently, comprehensive data about the structure and function of glycans have been accumulated, therefore the need for methods and algorithms to analyze these data is growing fast.Results: This article presents novel methods for classifying glycans and detecting discriminative glycan motifs with support vector machines (SVM). We propose a new class of tree kernels to measure the similarity between glycans. These kernels are based on the comparison of tree substructures, and take into account several glycan features such as the sugar type, the sugar bound type or layer depth. The proposed methods are tested on their ability to classify human glycans into four blood components: leukemia cells, erythrocytes, plasma and serum. They are shown to outperform a previously published method. We also applied a feature selection approach to extract glycan motifs which are characteristic of each blood component. We confirmed that some leukemia-specific glycan motifs detected by our method corresponded to several results in the literature.Availability: Softwares are available upon request.Contact:yoshi@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jpSupplementary information: Datasets are available at the following website: http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/supp/yoshi/glycankernel/},

	abstract = {Motivation: Glycan chains are synthesized by a combination of several kinds of glycosyltransferases (GTs). Thus, once we know the repertoire of GTs in the genome, in the transcriptome or in the proteome, it should in principle be possible to predict the repertoire of possible glycan structures in an organism or at a specific stage of the cell. Here, we show that a repertoire of glycan structures can be predicted from the set of GTs in the transcriptome. That is, using knowledge about glycan structure characteristics, we can predict glycan structures from incomplete or noisy data such as DNA microarray data.Results: First, we constructed a reaction pattern library consisting of bond-formation patterns of GT reactions and investigated the co-occurrence frequencies of all reaction patterns in the glycan database. This was followed by the prediction of glycan structures using this library and a co-occurrence score. A penalty score was also implemented in the prediction method. Then we examined the performance of prediction by the leave-one-out cross validation method using individual reaction pattern profiles in the KEGG GLYCAN database as virtual expression profiles. The accuracy of prediction was 81\%. Finally, we applied the prediction method to real expression data. Using expression profiles from the human carcinoma cell, glycan structures with sialic acid and sialyl Lewis X epitope were predicted, which corresponded well with experimental results.Contact:kanehisa@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jpSupplementary information:http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/{\textasciitilde}kawano/suppl/bioinfo2005/},

            Glycans serve important roles in signaling events and cell-cell communication, and they are recognized by lectins, viruses and bacteria, playing a variety of roles in many biological processes. However, there was no system to organize the plethora of glycan-related data in the literature. Thus GlyTouCan (https://glytoucan.org) was developed as the international glycan repository, allowing researchers to assign accession numbers to glycans. This also aided in the integration of glycan data across various databases. GlyTouCan assigns accession numbers to glycans which are defined as sets of monosaccharides, which may or may not be characterized with linkage information. GlyTouCan was developed to be able to recognize any level of ambiguity in glycans and uniquely assign accession numbers to each of them, regardless of the input text format. In this manuscript, we describe the latest update to GlyTouCan in version 3.0, its usage, and plans for future development.},

            PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a popular chemical information resource that serves a wide range of use cases. In the past two years, a number of changes were made to PubChem. Data from more than 120 data sources was added to PubChem. Some major highlights include: the integration of Google Patents data into PubChem, which greatly expanded the coverage of the PubChem Patent data collection; the creation of the Cell Line and Taxonomy data collections, which provide quick and easy access to chemical information for a given cell line and taxon, respectively; and the update of the bioassay data model. In addition, new functionalities were added to the PubChem programmatic access protocols, PUG-REST and PUG-View, including support for target-centric data download for a given protein, gene, pathway, cell line, and taxon and the addition of the ‘standardize’ option to PUG-REST, which returns the standardized form of an input chemical structure. A significant update was also made to PubChemRDF. The present paper provides an overview of these changes.},
